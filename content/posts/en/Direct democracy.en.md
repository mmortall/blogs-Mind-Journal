## ðŸ”¹ Classical theoretical works

1. **Jean-Jacques Rousseau - *The Social Contract* (1762)**

   * One of the first systematizers of the idea of direct popular sovereignty.

   * Criticized the representative system as distorting the "general will."
2. **John Stuart Mill - *On Liberty* (1859)**

   * Not directly about direct democracy, but about the limits of majority power and mechanisms for participation.
3. **Karl Schmitt - *Constitutional Theory* (1928)**

   * Considered plebiscitary forms of democracy as an alternative to parliamentary democracy.

## ðŸ”¹ Modern research

1. **David Altman - *Direct Democracy Worldwide* (2011)**

   * A systematic analysis of referendums, initiatives and plebiscites in different countries.

   * Probably the most cited contemporary book on the subject.
2. **Bruno Kaufmann, Rolf BÃ¼chi, Nadja Braun - *Guidebook to Direct Democracy* (2005)**

   * A practical guide on how initiative and referendum mechanisms are implemented.
3. **Hanspeter Kriesi - Research on Switzerland**

   * An analysis of how direct democracy works in a country where it is institutionalized.

## ðŸ”¹ Practice and cases

* **Switzerland** is a benchmark of institutionalized direct democracy: referendums and initiatives as part of the political system.

* **USA** - initiatives and referendums are widely used at the state level (especially California, Oregon).

* **Italy** - referendums on abolition of laws.

* **Latin America** (Uruguay, Venezuela, Bolivia) - experiments with direct plebiscites, but with different consequences.

## ðŸ”¹ Digital Direct Democracy

1. **"Liquid Democracy"** (Christoph Lenz, 2012

***

## ðŸ”¹ Criticism and limitations

* **Jason Brennan - *Against Democracy* (2016)**

  * Argues that mass participation is often irrational, and direct democracy works even worse than representative democracy.
* **Giovanni Sartori - *Democracy: What It Is, and Is Not* (1987)**

  * Considers direct democracy to be virtually impossible in large societies.

âœ… That is, the field is already quite broad: from Enlightenment philosophers to contemporary political scientists (Altman, Kaufmann, Kriesi) and practitioners of "digital democracy".
