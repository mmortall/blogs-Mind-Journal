# Mind-Journal 🧠✍️

**Mind-Journal** is my personal blog where I share ideas, research, and reflections on [**Sytrism**](https://mmortall.github.io/blogs-Mind-Journal/posts/en/sytrism-as-a-new-form-of-government/) and contemporary political thought.  
Here I explore the intersections of philosophy, political science, and futurism to rethink governance from a new perspective.

## 🔍 Topics

- Political theory and alternative forms of governance  
- The concept of **Sytrism** as a model of "cyber-triarchy"  
- The impact of technology, AI, and networked communities on democracy  
- Referendums, direct democracy, and practices of popular participation  
- Personal notes, experiments, and reflections

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is not just a collection of articles, but a space for exploring new ideas about the future of politics.  
I aim to describe how human values, algorithmic rationality, and collective intelligence can be combined in systems of governance.
